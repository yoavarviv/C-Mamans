# C-Mamans

This repository was created for two main reasons:
+ Easy switching between my machines.
+ Hopefully for future learning of the next student of the course.

If you are a student in the course, please do notice I do not, in any way, condone copying code off here. It is ONLY here for educational purposes, and not so you can get a high grade easily. Please use it wisely :)
