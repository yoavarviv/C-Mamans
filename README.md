## C-Mamans

This repository was created for two main reasons:
+ Easy switching between my machines.
+ Future learning of the next student of the course.

If you are a student in the course, please do notice I do not, in any way, condone copying code off here. It is ONLY here for educational purposes, and not so you can get a high grade easily. 

Please use it wisely :)

**NOTE**

The code snippets in here are not the only solution, if you programmed a different solution, it does not mean yours is wrong.
This was written in Semester 2022A.
