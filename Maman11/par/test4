"This is a string test"
"It should always be balanced"
"Even if the parenthesis go crazy like this (}{([][[)((("
It should also be balanced if it's in the middle of the line_index
Like this "[}((([[}}}}" Ok?
String can also appear in balanced line:
( this is a {String "I'll close the parenthesis } but it shouldn't affect ) OK?" }) 
Text should be balanced
