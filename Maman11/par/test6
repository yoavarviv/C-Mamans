{
Thats a special case
A special case is when you have one curly parenthesis with only white spaces in the line
(The line where they appear should be unbalanced)
But it shouldn't hurt the text balance if they get close in the end
}
	 {  		
This should also {work} if there [are] only whitespaces and a curly bracket 
	    }
Text should be balanced
